synopsis: "An opinionated asynchronous stream-processing framework"
description: """
Async_iterator provides a suite of tools for building single-process,
multi-process-pipeline, and distributed stream processing applications. It aims to provide
an ergonomic interface, competitive with traditional queue- or pipe-based solutions, while
strongly encouraging good performance and correctness practices, via said interface.

Async_iterator is relied upon by many of the most mission-critical systems at Jane Street.
