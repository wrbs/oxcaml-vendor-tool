synopsis: "Bytes library distributed with the OCaml compiler"
description: """
Empty library to fulfill the `bytes` dependency in Dune builds. `bytes` is not
necessary to get access to `Bytes` since OCaml 4.02 and that is the lowest
version Dune supports but starting with OCaml 5 the library doesn't exist as
part of the compiler anymore so such builds would fail.

A proper solution is to remove `bytes` from the `(libraries)` stanza in Dune,
but in the meantime this package provides a stop-gap solution to make these
builds succeed (while not pulling in a findlib dependency).

  "Do not install `base-bytes.opam` into an OPAM switch, it will not result in a working `bytes` library. This package is purely meant to be used with opam-monorepo. Use `opam install base-bytes.base` to install the right package in an OPAM switch."
