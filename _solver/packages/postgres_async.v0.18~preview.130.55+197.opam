synopsis:
  "OCaml/async implementation of the postgres protocol (i.e., does not use C-bindings to libpq)"
description: """
postgres_async is an OCaml PostgreSQL client that implements the PostgreSQL
protocol rather than binding to the libpq C library. It provides support for
regular queries (including support for 'parameters': "SELECT * WHERE a = $1")
and COPY IN mode. The interface presented is minimal to keep the library simple
for now, though in the future a layer on top may add convenience functions.
